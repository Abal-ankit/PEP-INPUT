1. There are two types of events, namely forground(triggered by user interaction) and background(user is not directly involved).
2. Event propagation is the process by which an event moves through the DOM hierarchy when triggered. It consists of three pahse:
    => Capturing Phase (Capture):
        The event travels from the root element of the DOM down to the target element.

    => Target Phase:
        The event reaches the target element where it was triggered.

    => Bubbling Phase (Bubble):
        The event then travels back up from the target element to the root element

3. The Virtual DOM in React is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is a JavaScript object that React uses to determine the minimal changes needed to update the real DOM efficiently.

        How it works:
        Rendering: React creates a virtual DOM tree when a component renders.
        Diffing: When the state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one (a process   called "diffing").
        Updating: React calculates the minimal changes (or "patches") and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
        This process improves performance by reducing direct manipulation of the real DOM, which is slow.

4. A Synthetic Event in React is a wrapper around the native browser event. It standardizes events across all browsers, providing a consistent API. React creates synthetic events to ensure compatibility and performance. Some example of synthetic event are event.target, event.currentTarget, event.type, event.preventDefault(), event.stopProgation().
